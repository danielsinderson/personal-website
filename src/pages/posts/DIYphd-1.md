# Why?
I've designed my own course of advanced study for two reasons. The first is that a standard PhD program isn't an option: fellowships don't pay enough to support a family. The second is that my ideal course of study straddles the line between mathematics, philosophy, and the sciences in a way that's difficult to capture within a traditional graduate program. It's a generalist's curriculum rather than a specialist's.

For course texts I tried to balance readability, coverage, and the availability/price. It's extraordinary how many of these texts are made available for free by the author(s). Also, everything here is tentative. As things progress I may switch up the schedule, change texts, or even alter the courses.
