### Course Description
This is course 2B in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1).
It's a year-long course in applied category theory and the basics of higher dimensional category theory, in particular double categories and their applications.


### Course Materials
The primary texts will be *Seven Sketches in Compositionality* by Brendan Fong and David Spivak and the first half of *Higher Dimensional Categories* by Marco Grandis.
