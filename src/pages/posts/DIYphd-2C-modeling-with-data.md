### Course Description
This is course 2C in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1).
It's a year-long course in statistical modeling and machine learning for both time-series and cross-sectional data.

### Course Materials
- The primary text will be *Foundations of Applied Mathematics vol. 3* by Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis, and Emily J. Evans. 
- This also includes a freely available [lab supplement](/FAM_lab_supplement_Volume3.pdf).
