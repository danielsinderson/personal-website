### Course Description
This is course 1A in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1), a year-long course on foundational concepts and techniques from mathematical analysis.
This will include abstract vector spaces and inner product spaces, metric spaces, manifolds, measures, and integration.

### Course Materials
- The primary text will be ***Foundations of Applied Mathematics vol. 1*** by Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis, and Emily J. Evans. 
- This also includes a freely available [lab supplement](/public/FAM_lab_supplement_Volume1.pdf).
- I'll also be supplementing with the following texts to dig deeper into the mathematics or simply review. They're all excellent and either free or very cheap.
    - ***Linear Algebra Done Right*** by Sheldon Axler
    - ***Understanding Analysis*** by Stephen Abbott
    - ***Measure, Integral, Probability & Processes*** by Ren√© Schilling
