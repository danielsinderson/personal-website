Last September I started work as a data specialist for a local toy company.
It's been fun, but busy enough that I held off on beginning my grad program until after Christmas, and then until after end of year reporting and retrospectives, and now that I've been promoted (wee!) I'm postponing again to sidequest some material in data engineering, causal modeling, forecasting, and regression.

The curriculum I've already planned out is ultimately relevant to my position, but in a high-octane, theoretically supercharged kind of way.
Right now what I need is to round out my fundamentals.

So, with that in mind, I present my sidequest!
