### Course Description
This is course 1C in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1), a year-long course on foundational concepts and techniques from general computer science, and the subfields of approximation and optimization.
This will include algorithms and data structures, approximating functions with series and wavelets, and linear and nonlinear optimization.

### Course Materials
- The primary text will be ***Foundations of Applied Mathematics vol. 2*** by Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis, and Emily J. Evans. 
- This also includes a freely available [lab supplement](/public/FAM_lab_supplement_Volume2.pdf).
- Lastly, I'll be supplementing the computer science portion of the course with ***Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*** by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman, which is freely available [here](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf).
