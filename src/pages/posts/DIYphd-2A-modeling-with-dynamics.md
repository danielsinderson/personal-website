### Course Description
This is course 2A in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1).
It's a year-long course in dynamical systems, differential equations, and optimal control theory.

### Course Materials
- The primary text will be ***Foundations of Applied Mathematics vol. 4*** by Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis, and Emily J. Evans. 
- This includes a freely available [lab supplement](/FAM_lab_supplement_Volume4.pdf).
