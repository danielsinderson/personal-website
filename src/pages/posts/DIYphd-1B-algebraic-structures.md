### Course Description
This is course 1B in my [DIY graduate program](/posts/DIYphd-1), a year-long course looking at set theory, category theory, and algebraic structures in an applied setting.


### Course Materials
- The primary text will be *Applied Compositional Thinking for Engineers*, an in-progress draft by the Frazzoli group at ETH Zurich and the Zardini group at MIT. It's freely available [here](https://applied-compositional-thinking.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ACT4E-public-slow.pdf).
- I'll also be supplementing with ***Algebra: Chapter 0*** by Paulo Aluffi.
